# Movie Trailer Website
This program showcases some of my favorite movies that I highly recommend.

fresh_tomatoes.py was provided by Udacity but I have modified it so
when a movie is clicked on, instead of showing only a trailer it now has a
synopsis of the movie under the trailer.

## How to run
Run entertainment_center.py and the program will automatically generate
the html file and open it in your browser.
